## Running locally

I used VSCode, which has built in typescript support. To debug it uses a tiny webserver to host the files on localhost. 

To run do `npm install` to restore packages and then `npm start` to start the webserver

## Running in Docker

`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up`

navigate your web browser to 127.0.0.1
